Updated - Important Pointers for Exams
Important Note:

Terraform Exams are updated regularly. Following are the additional list of videos that are recently added to the course and are important for the exams:



1. Requirements for publishing module in Terraform Registry 
2. Air Gapped Environments 
3. Zipmap function
4. Comments in Terraform


Here is the list of additional important pointers that are important for the exams whose videos are not yet available in the course. We will soon release the videos.



1. List:

list(...): a sequence of values identified by consecutive whole numbers starting with zero. The keyword list is a shorthand for list(any), which accepts any element type as long as every element is the same type



2. Variable Names

We cannot use all words within variable names. Terraform reserves some additional names that can no longer be used as input variable names for modules. These reserved names are:



count
depends_on
for_each
lifecycle
providers
source


3. Index Function

index finds the element index for a given value in a list.

4. Terraform Enterprise

Before mid-2019, all distributions of Terraform Cloud used to be called Terraform Enterprise; the self-hosted distribution was called Private Terraform Enterprise (PTFE).

Terraform Enterprise supports the following data storage:

PostgresSQL
 
Any S3-compatible object storage service, GCP Cloud Storage or Azure blob storage meets Terraform Enterprise's object storage requirements.
If you already run your own Vault cluster in production, you can configure Terraform Enterprise to use that instead of running its own internal Vault instance.

3. API and CLI access for Terraform Cloud can be managed through API tokens that can be generated from Terraform Cloud UI.



4. Terraform uses Parallelism to reduce the time it takes to create the resource. By default, this value is set to 10

5. Terraform recommends using an Indent two spaces for each nesting level.



ami           = "abc123"

7. The terraform get command is used to download and update modules mentioned in the root module.

8. The Sentinel command-line interface (CLI) allows for the developing and testing of policies outside of a particular Sentinel implementation
